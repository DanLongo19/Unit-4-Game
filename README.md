# Unit-4-Game

Notes at the bottom of my .js file

I think I did everything correctly as I have no errors, however the game isn't functioning correctly.. 

1. the target score won't populate with a random number
2. I can't get anything to print through HTML (tried both .innerhtml and .html) - now messing with the "ids" - do i want to use -- return this.sftartingScore + " " + this.targetScore
3. I get a win no matter what on the first click but any click after gives me the loss alert
